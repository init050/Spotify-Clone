A comprehensive, open-source Spotify clone built with a modern Django and Docker stack. It provides a robust, scalable backend API for a feature-rich music streaming service, designed to be a standout portfolio piece for developers.

> **Note:** This project is a backend-focused application. For the full experience, you will need to connect a frontend application to this API.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Get a fully operational local instance of the platform running in minutes.

### Prerequisites
-   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
-   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/init050/spotify-clone.git
cd spotify-clone
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Copy the example environment file. The default values are configured for the local Docker setup and should work out of the box.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
*You should review the file and set a new `SECRET_KEY`.*

### 3. Build and Run the Services
This command will build the Docker images and start all the services (web app, database, Redis, etc.) in the background.

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

### 4. Apply Database Migrations
Once the containers are running, apply the database migrations to set up the schema.

```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
```

### 5. Run the Celery Worker
For asynchronous tasks like audio processing to work, you need to run at least one Celery worker. Open a **new terminal window** and run:

```bash
docker-compose exec web celery -A Spotify_Clone worker --loglevel=info
```
*(In the next step, we will update `docker-compose.yml` to run this automatically.)*

The application API is now running and available at `http://localhost:8000`.
